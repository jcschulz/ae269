    "When we solve this PDE numerically, we divide the spatial and temporal domains into a series of mesh points and time points. Assume our problem domain is of length $L$, and that we want to compute the solution of $u(x,t)$ between time equals to zero to some final time, $t_f$ for all values of $x$ between zero and $L$. The first step in solving our PDE numerically is to divide the domain, $0 \\leq x \\leq L$, into a discrete number of mesh points or nodes, $N_x$. Likewise, we also divide the time domain, $0 \\leq t \\leq t_f$, into a discrete number of time steps, $N_t$. If we do so uniformally in time and space, then the distance bewteen each mesh point is $\\Delta x$, and the distance between each time step is $\\Delta t$. \n",

To do this requires using a Taylor series expansion about each point in the mesh, both in time and space, to approximate the time and space derivatives of $u$ in terms of a difference formula. Since in our Taylor series expansion we choose only a finite number of terms, these difference formulas are known as finite-difference approximations.\n",

We have free reign in this choice, and most importantly, we certainly not limited to those provided above. It is possible to derive, third and fourth-order finite-difference approximations. These higher-order methods can become increasingly complex. Note, however, that while we can freely choose the difference approximation, we still need to check that this difference equation is not only consistent but also stable. Different combinations of time and spatial difference approximations result in different numerically stability.\n",
